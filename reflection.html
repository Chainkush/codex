    <td>In my old works, I combine precision and control with an intuitive, improvisational approach. I adapt the seamlessness of digital media and the softness of the airbrush to portray the ideal world in my mind. I seek to balance scientific concepts of form, space, and structure with art's emotive and affective qualities, allowing emotion to transcend dimensions while still respecting the boundaries of rationalism. <br><br>

        Through the process of creating this 3D-printed sculpture, such an idea is enhanced. With the help of 3D software and a 3D printer, the seamlessness and accuracy are more certain. The accuracy contrast with the ambiguous edge of the airbrush, and the euphoric aesthetic creates a larger gap between reality and the figure, providing the audience with a Meta experience. The format of the sculpture provides a closer glimpse at the ideal world in my mind, allowing a clash between the surreal and the real. <br><br>
        
        Additionally, I hope to gain insight into the ways in which virtual reality becomes real. This project will serve as an opportunity to reflect on my old artistic practice, deepen my 3D software skills, and engage with a social critique of virtual behavior.
